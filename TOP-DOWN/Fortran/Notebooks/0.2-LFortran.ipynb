    "# Why Fortran?\n",
    "Specifically targeting fundamentally computational tasks, it requires no external libraries, it is simple to read and write, and all the essentials that are needed is self-contained in the language itself. Fortran is highly optimized with efficient computational power and naturally readable language, which is why the majority of HPC application codes are written mostly or completely in Fortran."
