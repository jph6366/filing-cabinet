* PumasAI
A team of scientists and scientfic computing experts
- helping pharmaceutical scientists, healthcare providers, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical companies
  _deliver better treatments to patients faster_

  _Products_

  1. *Pumas*
     Pharmaceutical Modeling And Simulation
     - it is a suite of tools used to perform quantitative analytics of various kinds
       - across pharmaceutical drug development

     - provides efficient implementations of all aspects of the analytics
       - in this domain under one cohesive package

  2. *DeepPumas*
     Neural-network infrastructure for SciML models (designed for the healthcare industry)
     - of longitudinal data
       - e.g. pharmaceutical modeling,
         - while leveraging the non-linear mixed effects (NLME) functionality
     _2 ways of enhancing Pumas models with ML_
     1. Embedding Neural Networks directly in a `@model`
     2. predicting a part of individual variability from baseline covariates via neural networks

  3. *PumasCP*
           Clinical Pharmacology Analysis & Reporting Tool
     - Bioequivalence Analysis
     - Toxicokinectic Analysis
     - Non-compartmental Analysis
     _Pumas is the only software that matches SAS for BE anaylsis_
