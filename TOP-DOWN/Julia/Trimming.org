#+title: Trimming

Trimming is based on the observation that, if the static subset of your call graph encompasses your entire program, Julia ought to be able to compile the whole program to a single, static binary. Trimming has been worked on by the core devs for several years, and recently, their work has born fruit: An early experimental version landed in the 1.12 release and can now be used.
