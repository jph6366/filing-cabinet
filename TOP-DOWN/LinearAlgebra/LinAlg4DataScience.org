* Linear Algebra in R

** Vectors
- use the rep() command to create vectors
  - that repeats the same element a specified number of times
- use seq() command to create vector that follow a specified pattern
- vectors are also manually created by c() command (cocatenate)
- vectors can be scaled via multiplication, and more
  - matrices can be created using the matrix() command
#+begin_src r
# Creating three 3's and four 4's, respectively
rep(3, 3)
rep(4, 4)

# Creating a vector with the first three even numbers and the first three odd numbers
seq(2, 6, by = 2)
seq(1, 5, by = 2)

# Re-creating the previous four vectors using the 'c' command
c(3, 3, 3)
c(4, 4, 4, 4)

c(2, 4, 6)
c(1, 3, 5)

# Add x to y and print
print(x + y)

# Multiply z by 2 and print
print(2 / z)

# Multiply x and y by each other and print
print(x * y)

# Add x to z, if possible, and print
print(x + z)

* Linear Algebra in Julia

** Vectors
- vectors in julia are represented by one-dimensional `Array` objects
  - constructed by giving the list of elements`[ x, y, z ]`
    - assignment operator `=` is used to give a name to the array
- specific elements are retrieved by the expressions x[i]
  - special index `end` refers to the last index
_assignment versus copying_
- this expression `y = x` gives a new name `y`
  - to the same array already referenced by `x`
  - it does not create a new copy of `x`
- to create a new copy of an array use `copy`
- equality of vectors is checked using relation operator `==`
_scalars versus 1-vectors_
- we consider a 1-vector to be the same as a number
  - in Julia 1-vectors are not the same as scalars/numbers
_block or stacked vectors_
- construct a block using `vcat` or the semicolon operator
_subvectors and slicing_
- expression `r:s` denotes the index range $r,r+1,...s$
  - we use $x_{r:s}$ to denote the slice of vector x from index r to s
- one can use a third argument to specify the stride, which is the increment/pattern
  - see example representing below mathematical notation for _vector of first diffs_
    $d_{i} = x_{i+1} - x_{i}$ for $i=1,...,n-1$
_list of vectors_
- an ordered list of n-vecs can be denoted:
  $a_{1},...a_{k}$ or $a^{1},...,a^{k}$

$e_i$ the ith unit vector of length n
$1_{n}$ or just 1

_random vectors_
- it is useful to genrate random vecs to test an identity or some algo
  - `rand(n)` generates a random vector of length n with entries that are between 0 and 1
  - `randn(n)` the extra `n` is for normal, gives an n-vector with entries that come from a *Gaussian distribution*, can be positive or negative
    - with typical values on the order of one
      #+begin_src julia
  x = [-1.0, 0.0, 3.6, -7.2]
  length(x)
  y = [-1.1; 0.0; 3.5; -7.2]
  length(y)
  x[end]
  x[1] = 4.0;
  y = x
  y[1] = 2.0;
  y = copy(x);
  y == x # true
  x = [ 1.3 ] # 1-vector
  x = [1, -2]; y = [1, 1, 0];
  z = [x;y] # concatenate
  z = vcat(x,y)
  y = x[2:4]
  x[4:5] = [2,3]
  x[1:3:5]
  y[end:-1:1] # index range runs backwards
  d = x[2:end] - x[1:end-1] # (n-1)-vector
  [x, y, z] # array of arrays
  [x;y;z]# array of numbers obtained thru concatenation
  zeros(3) # zero vector length 3
  ei = zeros(4)
  ei[2] = 1
  unitvec(i,n) = [zeros(i-1); 1 ; zeros(n-i)]
  ones(2) # ones vectors
  rand(2)
  randn(2)
