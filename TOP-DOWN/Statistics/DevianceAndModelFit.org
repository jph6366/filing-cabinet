#+title: Deviance And Model Fit

Deviance is a key concept in logistic regression.
- it measure the deviance of the fitted logistic model w.r.t. a perfect model for $\mathbb{P}[Y=1|X_1=x_1,...,X_k=x_k]$
  /perfect model is known as a saturated model/
  - an abstract model that fits perfectly the sample

    _deviance is defined as the difference of likelihoods between the fitted model and saturated model_

    $D=-2\log lik(\hat{\beta})+2 \log lik(saturated model)$
    since the the likelihood of the saturated model is exactly one
    - then the deviance is simply another expression of the likelihood...
      $D=-2\log lik(\hat{\beta})$
      *deviance is always larger or equal than zero*

      _evaluating the magnitude of deviance is the null deviance_

      $D_0 = -2 \log like(\hat\beta)$

      _deviance of the worst model, the one fitted without any predictor to the perfect model_

      $Y|(X_1=x_1,...,X_k=x_k)\sim Ber(logistic(\beta_0))$

      in this case, $\hat\beta_0 = logit(\frac{m}{n}) = \log \frac{\frac{m}{n}}{1-\frac{m}{n}}$
      where $m$ is the number of $1$ s in $Y_1,...,Y_n$

      *null deviance serves for comparing how much the model has improved*
      - by adding the predictors and can be done by means of the $R^2$ statistic
        - which is a generalization of the determination coefficient
          - _mulitple linear regression_

            $R^2 = 1 - \frac{D}{D_0} = 1 - \frac{deviance(fitted logistic, saturated model)}{deviance(null model, saturated model)}$

/in logistic regression, $R^2$ does have the same interpretation/
- it is a ratio of indicating how close is the fit
  - to being perfect or the worst

    The connexion between and the *determination coefficient* is given by the expressions of the *deviance* and *null of the deviance* for the linear model:

    $D=SSE (or D = RSS) and D_0 = SST$
